### PROSSTT scripts

PROSSTT (PRObabilistic Simulations of ScRNA-seq Tree-like Topologies) is a package with code for the simulation of scRNAseq data for dynamic processes such as cell differentiation. PROSSTT is open source GPL-licensed software implemented in Python (also see the [repository](https://github.com/soedinglab/prosstt/) and the [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/31/256941.1)).

Here we present the Jupyter notebooks and the python code that were used for the analysis of scRNA-seq data and the fitting of hyperparameters (referenced in the Supplementary Material of the paper).
